# 0030 v-bind and v-model

## ```v-bind``` vs ```v-model```
n simple words v-model is for two way bindings means: if you change input value, the bound data will be changed and vice versa.

but v-bind:value is called one way binding that means: you can change input value by changing bound data but you can't change bound data by changing input value through the element.
