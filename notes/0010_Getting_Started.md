# 0010 Getting Started

## Frameworks

## What is Vue?

View is a JavaScript Framework.  

* Client-side framework.  Relies on API for back-end
* Third-party libraries
* Approach to structuring the application
* Gives modern look and feel.  (Behaves more like a mobile app)  Moves quickly.  Data is loaded behind the scene as much as possible.
* Allows focus on buisiness models, rather than mechanics of rendering

You can use Vue to control just part of a page.  Or it can be all of the screen.  For example, could just do a chat app or a sidebar.





## Vue vs React vs Angular

React lacks things like routing.  There are third-party additions, but it isn't integral.

Angular is a lot more complicated

Vue is weaker than React on mobile devices.  There are some ways to get around this.

* Use Weex   [https://weex.apache.org/guide/use-vue-in-weex.html#the-web-renderer](https://weex.apache.org/guide/use-vue-in-weex.html#the-web-renderer)
* Avoid using DOM-centric actions because phones don't have a DOM.  

Vue is a good starting point.  It has the fundamentals across all frameworks.
