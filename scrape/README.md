# This code scrapes the MWSU schedule by department.

## the ./data folder contains .html files for each department.  It also contains a bash script called "fetchAll" that will get a fresh set of data.

## The code is horrible style, but it mostly works.Some things like class times and days should have been captured as arrays, but they aren't at this point.
